### App Idea
Study Up
An app that's take the idea of active recall but makes it more intuitive and combines it with a To-Do list of items. So for example, you can input all the sections or topics to cover in a class, and the app will generate a study schedule. You can choose if there is an upcoming exam, or how aggressive you want the active recall to be.

## Notes

Everything was pretty easy to implement
